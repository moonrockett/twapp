-great. add the seconds to the timer for each reset too. also lets start on how the boosters will actually be restarted. each booster is linked to a telegram channel. its ideal if that channel name is also visilein the button. one a user taps on an inative booster, it asks for " the post string" this is a srting of letters. the idea is that in the specific telegram channel for each booster, each post made will have a specific letter as a "code" the job of the user is to, in order to activate the booster, go to the linked channel, look at the last five posts made in the channel and get the "code" letter for each post. this will give the user a string of 5 letter which when entered, activates the booster. repeat this back to me so i kniow you understand. the point is to be able to get the views of the users of the webapp registers as views on telegram chaneel posts so we can earn via monitisation of the channels, do you undrstand?

-yes perfect. implement it. in principle the "post string" is a chain that keeps on going on as new posts are added to the channels so im guessign there will be a need for an admin pannel or some sort of way to link the channels and the app or atleast let them communicate the "code" letters as they are added to the posts in the channel. maybe you can suggersts a simple way to achieve that too. im thinking it whould be easier if the app generates the random "code" letters and the admin of the app and the channels has that list so they can eaily know and add the next "code " letter to any new post they make. impletent teh upper thing you said and respoind to this prompt so i can make a desiciion on hoe to achieve it.
